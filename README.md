# Better Web Audio

A simple class which uses the Web Audio system for perfect loading and looping. Has fallbacks for fetch (to XHR) and Web Audio API (to Audio class).

I made this because I was asked how to loop audio without a pause and I got annoyed at having to handle all of the different systems that come with the Web Audio API.

Use it however you see fit.
